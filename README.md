This project is part of the ALX Frontend curriculum. It builds on basic HTML/CSS concepts and dives deeper into advanced CSS techniques, including:

CSS Flexbox & Grid for layout

Responsive design (works on smartphones and desktops)

Styling elements beyond the basics (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)

Use of external CSS files (base.css and styles.css) to separate concerns

Semantic HTML structure styled with modern CSS practices
